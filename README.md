### Preventing Recycling Contamination Residential Recycling Feedback Survey Analysis

##### Abstract

The City of Lansing is in need of reducing recycling contamination as they transition to a new materials recovery facility. 
Previous studies of program participation and contamination audits exclude direct residential feedback. 
A survey was developed based on previous research and distributed to Lansing residents. 
Data relating to the following areas of interest was collected: communication methods, disposal habits based on categories of materials and situations, and effects of contamination on the recycling process. 
Regarding levels of contamination over time, results show estimated averages of contamination occurrences per route in 2017 and 2019 to remain constant. 
Regarding situational recycling, the observed residential contamination rates do not significantly differ from national residential contamination rates. 
Regarding disposal of ambiguous items (materials that are possibly recyclable), results are insignificant between proportions of respondents recycling or wasting the item. 
Each of these results show rates remaining constant. 
To reduce contamination rates, it is imperative to conduct continuing research on residential experience of informational resources in conjunction with inbound contamination audits in order to accurately assess changes in contamination rates over time. 
This analysis supplements the Preventing Recycling Contamination Sustainability Report delivered to the city of Lansing.
